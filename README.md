# project_synergy by Thomas Countoures
A web app I've been making from the ground up. Using AngularJS as my front end framework. On the server side I'm using Node.js, Express, MySQL. Cutting out some repetitive tasks with Grunt. Using this as a learning experience, and because it's fun. I'm quite literally developing this right now, so if you see a lot of random code comments and console logs, that's probably why.

# important (I guess?) info
I've obviously left out the database information like login, password, tables information, etc. If for some reason you may be interested in cloning this, I plan to write up some simple instructions on setting up a database so you can see this project later on. 

I am using the following bower components: (will continue to update)

* AngularJS
* Angular UI Router
* Angular Cookies
* Bootstrap
* Underscore.js
