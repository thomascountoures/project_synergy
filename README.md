# project_synergy by Thomas Countoures
An app I've been making from the ground up. Using AngularJS, Node.js, Express, Sass, MySQL, Underscore.js, Grunt, vanilla JavaScript. Using this as a learning experience, and because it's fun.

# important (I guess?) info
You can clone this repo, but I've obviously left out the database information like login, password, tables information, etc. If for some reason you may be interested in this, you will need to set up the MySQL database and any other information on your localhost. At the current time, I am using the following bower components:

AngularJS
Angular UI Router
Bootstrap
Underscore

# other cool stuff
Nothing else really. I'll keep this updated as I go along.
